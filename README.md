This repository contains a custom implementation of version control functionality. It is designed to track changes to files, manage different versions of a project, and provide features similar to popular version control systems (e.g., Git). The code allows users to efficiently handle various development tasks such as committing changes, branching, merging, and viewing the history of modifications

Happy Coding!
